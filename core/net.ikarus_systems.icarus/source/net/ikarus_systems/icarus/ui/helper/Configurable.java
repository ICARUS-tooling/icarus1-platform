/**
 * Serves as a kind of "flag" to mark objects that can be "configured"
 * by the user in some way. The {@link #openConfig()} method serves as
 * delegate to access the real configuration. This does not have to be
 * the default {@code ConfigDialog} implementation but can be something
 * as simple as a little {@code Dialog} with some input components like
 * text-fields or check-boxes. It is recommended that any class that
 * wishes to be presented to the user as part of some UI should implement
 * this interface in case it features configuration possibilities.
